# Openshift-Dev-Cheatsheet

Our Cheatsheet for Openshift Developers. Only in German (for now).

## Scope

This intends to help developers when debugging an application or performing maintenance on it.

What it does not try to do is helping with application setup on OpenShift and maintaining the configuration - there are many different approacheds to do that (kustomize, Ansible, Helm, ...).

More commands will follow.
